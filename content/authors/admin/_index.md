Hello! I'm Guanwen Xie(Ë∞¢ÂÜ†Êñá), a senior year undergraduate student from Zhejiang University, and I'll start my M.S. studies at Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. Daoyi Chen and Yong Ren. 

I major in Ocean Technology and I have keen interest in Computer Science and AI. The main topic of my research is empowering robot learning and robot-assisted underwater tasks by data-driven methods like reinforcement learning(RL). For this goal, I'll keep studying the frontiers of RL, such as imitation learning(IL), offline RL, multi-agent RL and multi-goal RL. Hopefully, my research can help (underwater) agents efficiently acquire general and robust decision-making behaviors in various environments. Keep going!üí™
