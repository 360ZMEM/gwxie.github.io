abstract: As a powerful promoter of Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) are widely used in various IoUT applications such as underwater detection and information acquisition. However, the complex and variable marine environment makes the development and validation of UUV control algorithm face the challenge of high cost and high risk. In this paper, we propose IMTVSim, an integrated modular training and verification simulator for UUVs that integrates customizable modules such as high-precision simulation scenarios, dynamics models, sensors, and controllers, while providing a reinforcement learning (RL) environment to train UUV intelligence to complete complex tasks. And we take the underwater pursuit-evasion game (UPEG) as the specific task for simulator verification, while proposing an efficient training framework dedicated for UPEG (also named ETFDU), which includes multi-agent decentralized training decentralized execution (DTDE) technology, scenario transfer training (STT) method, and decision transformer (DT) based offline RL technique to assist UUV efficient training. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of IMTVSim are proved by training UUVs and target to complete the UPEG task.
