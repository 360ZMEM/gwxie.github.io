              Developed a compact, energy-save and control-easy underwater robot via Raspberry Pi, STM32 and computer vision algorithms, with the functions of navigation, obstacle avoidance, letter and color recognition. Specifically, we utilize BAGAN for data augmentation for letter recognition, which significantly improves the accuracy of the recognition task. We participated in the underwater robot competition of Zhejiang Province and won the first prize.

              Analyze the stoke vector image and parameterize the enhanced image, then maximize the proposed enhanced EME(measure of enhancement by entropy), and finally utilize haze removal algorithm to make underwater image enhancement. I've also participated in applying this algorithm to a project concerning underwater 3D reconstruction. For this, I've studied the basic knowledge about SLAM.
