              Build a framework utilizing the large language model(LLM) to produce zero-shot interpretable dense reward functions and heuristic python code, while realizing iterative refinement with self-evolution feedback. Finally, they are applied in the multi-AUV underwater data collection task, with multiple objectives to be optimized.

              An underwater robot simulation platform is built, highlighting high-fidelity simulation and customizable modules. Based on this platform, we built an expert-driven, reward function irrelevant simulation to simulation(sim2sim) training framework utilizing multi-agent imitation learning(IL) and transformer-based offline reinforcement learning(ORL).

              A enhancing procedure maximizing the EME(measure of enhancement by entropy) of underwater polarized images based on stoke vector paramization and haze removal algorithm is proposed. I've also participated in applying this algorithm to a project concerning underwater 3D reconstruction and studied the basic knowledge about SLAM.
